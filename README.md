# Megathon-22-_Stellantis

Won the third prize in a nation-wide onsite hackathon organized by the E-Cell of IIIT Hyderabad. Our team "Dining Philosophers" worked on the problem statement given by Stellantis which was to improve the user's travel experience. The solution involved using AI and ML models to detect the face and emotions of the travelers in a vehicle, going through their Spotify details like the history and genre of songs listened and taking the intersection for all the travelers in order to create a playlist that caters to the interest of all thereby enhancing the travel experience.Won
